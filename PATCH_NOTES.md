# Patch 1.5 - Economy, Bosses & Quality of Life

### 🛠️ Key Fixes
*   **Gold Generation Restored**: Fixed an issue where passive gold generation (every minute) was paused. Resources now generate consistently.
*   **Instant Equipment Stats**: Fixed a bug where buying weapons didn't immediately update your defense/attack stats in the UI.

### 💰 Economy Updates
*   **Vault Spending**: You can now seamlessly use gold from your **Vault** to pay for upgrades and units across the Kingdom.
    *   **Gold Mine**: Use vault gold to upgrade the mine and train miners.
    *   **Vault**: Use vault gold to upgrade the vault itself.
    *   **Armoury**: Weapon purchases now respect the "Use Vault Gold" toggle.
*   **Smart Cost Indicators**: Buttons now correctly enable/disable based on your *total* available gold (Main + Vault).

### 💀 Boss Raids
*   **Kill Counters**: Boss cards now display how many times you have defeated each boss (e.g., "Defeated: 5 times").
    *   *Note: Tracking starts from this patch onwards.*

### 🛡️ Armoury Enhancements
*   **New Unit Summary**: Added a quick-view summary bar under the weapon tabs.
    *   See **Total Soldiers**, **Equipped**, **Unequipped**, and **Spare Weapons** at a glance.
    *   "Unequipped" count highlights in red if you have soldiers without gear.
